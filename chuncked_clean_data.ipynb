part of a long tradition of American optimism A reaffirmation of traditional values and beliefs A celebration Think of these crashes like you would Thanksgiving and the Fourth of July On these days we dont mourn the dead or rejoice in miracles No these are days of secular optimism Of selfcelebration Each crash is meant to be better than the last Theres a constant upgrading of tools skills a meeting of challenges An American film director says I want this flatbed truck to do a double midair somersault that produces an orange ball of fire in a foot diameter The movie breaks away from complicated human passions to show us something elemental something loud and fiery and headon Watch any car crash in any American movie It is a highspirited moment like oldfashioned stunt flying or walking on wings The people who stage these crashes are able to capture a lightheartedness a carefree enjoyment that car crashes in foreign movies can never approach You might say But what about all that blood and glass The screeching rubber the crushed bodies the severed limbs What kind of optimism is this Look past the violence I say There is a wonderful brimming spirit of innocence and fun Welcome freshmen Any questions ask me Welcome Come on freshmen Hey you guys Welcome Weve got to go Were doubleparked Do not rush me Traffic is bad right now Youre not planning on helping me move in I got all this stuff Hey buddy Weve got this I cant believe that you said that to my roommate You dont even know him Dont tell him my own business Youve tied this three times already Its the same every time I didnt like the way it looked Lets enjoy these aimless days while we can You should have been there Where Its the day of the station wagons Did I miss it again Youre supposed to remind me It was a brilliant event They stretched all the way past the music library and onto the interstate You know I need reminding Jack Theyll be back next year I hope so I realized it was I started the Hitler Studies program Ive witnessed this event now for years I dont care about the station wagons I wanted to see the people What are they like this year The women wear plaid skirts and cableknit sweaters I knew it And the men are in hacking jackets What is a hacking jacket Theyve grown comfortable with their money They believe that theyre entitled to it They glow a little I have trouble imagining death at that income level Maybe theres no death as we know it just documents changing hands How do astronauts float Theyre lighter than air There is no air They cant be lighter than something that isnt there Not that we dont have a station wagon Its small and maroon I thought space was cold It has a rusted door Space Our station wagon Its called the suns corolla We saw it on the Weather Network I thought Corolla was a car Everythings a car Wheres Wilder Wilder Wilder are you hungry How cold is space You still playing the fellow in prison I think Ive got him cornered Who did he kill He was under pressure How many did he shoot Five Five people Not counting the state trooper which was later This is not the lunch I planned for myself I was thinking yoghurt and wheat germ Where have we heard that before Probably right here You keep buying stuff you never eat Steffie Capricorn Babette thinks if she keeps buying it shell have to eat it We love her habits If anybody here has to show

fires in buildings start because of faulty wiring Phrase you cant hang around without hearing Youll add to your possessions Ill replace them He tries not to listen although he secretly wants to Its like love slash hate Did he know who he was killing or were they strangers Total strangers Was he hearing voices On TV yeah What did they say They told him to go down in history but I dont think he will Iron City is too small of a media market Okay Im going to take a shower and then well go to the mall and then Ill teach my posture class I didnt know we had Pringles Didnt she already shower

What do you want to do I want whatevers best for you Whats best for me is to please you But you please me by letting me please you Is it wrong for the man to be considerate to his partner Im your partner when were playing tennis which we ought to start doing again by the way Otherwise Im your wife Do you want me to read to you First rate Please dont choose anything that has men inside women or men entering women Got it Were not lobbies or elevators I wanted him inside me As if he could crawl completely in sign the register sleep eat and so forth I dont care what these people do as long as they dont enter or get entered Life is good Jack What brings this on I just feel it has to be said I want to die first You sound almost eager Life would feel unbearably sad and lonely without you Especially if the children were grown up and living elsewhere Right now were safe As long as the children are here They need us Its great having these kids around but once they get big and scattered I want to go first No Jack Your death would leave an abyss in my life Id be left talking to chairs and pillows Your death would be more than an abyss Whats more than an abyss A yawning gulf Your death would be a profound depth A void Dont be an ass Your death would leave a bigger hole in my life than mine would in yours Youll be fine Youll travel and live a new and exciting life Ill just sit in that chair in the suit that I wore to your funeral forever Youre wrong And you dont really want to die first You dont want to be alone but you dont want to die more than you dont want to be alone I

most prominent figures in Hitler Studies in North America Im JAK Gladney I I teach Advanced Nazism over at the CollegeontheHill So as you can understand its a great source of embarrassment for me that I dont speak German Maybe it explains the dark glasses but best not to analyze it As you can probably see something happens between the back of my tongue and the roof of my mouth After all I require my students to take a minimum of one year of German The urgency is the Hitler conference Its coming here to the CollegeontheHill in the spring and scholars from all over Germany will be in attendance Do you think you can get me up to speed on the basics of the language by then I also teach sailing Kleenex Softique your trucks blocking the entrance This is exciting We have these in New York The oven aroma of bread combined with the sight of a bloodstained man pounding strips of living veal is very exciting Murray Suskind this is my wife Babette Murray came to the college this year from New York Oh His specialty is living icons You have a very impressive husband Mrs Gladney Nobody in any university in this country can so much as utter a word about Hitler without a nod in JAKs direction literally or metaphorically Hes Jack in real life Hitler is now Gladneys Hitler I marvel at what youve done with the man I want to do the same with Elvis My dirt Dirts dirt Who are these children Yours Well theres Denise of course Hot and cold are words We have to use words We need more Glass Plus We cant just grunt Thats Heinrich there are more people dead today than in the rest of world

overcloseness the noise and the heat of being Tegrin Denorex Selsun Blue Your wifes hair is a living wonder Yes it is She has important hair I think I know what you mean I hope you appreciate that woman Absolutely A woman like that doesnt just happen I know it Dristan Ultra Dristan Ultra That stuff causes cancer in laboratory animals if you didnt know You wanted me to chew sugarless gum It was your idea There was no warning on the pack then Then they put a warning which I dont believe you didnt see Either I chew gum with sugar and artificial coloring or sugarless gum thats harmful to rats Its up to you Dont chew at all Ever think of that Denise Steffie Either I chew gum or I smoke Why not do both Thats what you want isnt it We all get to do what we want Unless were not allowed to because of our age and height Youre making a fuss over nothing I guess youre right Never mind Just a warning on the pack Just rats Just useless rodents Plus Id like to believe she only chews two pieces a day the way she forgets things What do I forget Its all right Never mind What do I forget Sunny Delight Sunny Delight Leon Parsley Let me help you up Uh Cheerios spill in aisle Sorry aisle You stole my visor Hey give it Sorry Lucky Charms Tell Denise youre sorry Maybe later Remind me Shes a great girl and she wants to be your older sister And your friend if you let her I dont know about friend Shes a little bossy Aside from telling her youre sorry be sure to give her back her book Its a medical journal She reads it all the time Its weird At least she reads something Its lists of drugs and medicines You want to know why she reads it Why Shes trying to find out the sideeffects of the stuff that Babette uses What does Baba use Dont ask me ask Denise How do you know she uses anything Ask Denise Why dont I ask Baba Ask Baba I know I forget things but I didnt know it was so obvious It isnt I dial a number and forget who Im calling I go to the store and I forget what to buy We all forget Sometimes I call Steffie Denise I forget where Ive parked the car I dont care what the girls say It cant be the gum I chew Thats too farfetched Maybe its something else What do you mean Maybe youre taking something besides chewing gum Where did you get that idea I got it from Steffie Where did Steffie get it from Denise What does Denise through Steffie say that Im taking I wanted to ask you before I asked her We always tell each other everything I am not taking anything that would affect my memory Jack These are the days that I want to remember Everybody forgets things Theres a lot going on My life is eitheror Either I chew regular gum or I chew sugarless gum Either I chew gum or I smoke Either I smoke or I gain weight Either I gain weight or I run up the stadium steps Sounds like a boring life I hope it lasts forever Do you drink coffee yet No Baba likes a cup when she gets back from class Her class is demanding Coffee relaxes her Thats why its dangerous Why is it dangerous Whatever relaxes you is dangerous What are we going to do about Baba She cant remember anything with those pills she takes We dont know for sure shes taking something I saw the empty bottle in the trash under the kitchen sink How do you know it was hers I saw her throw it out It had the name of the medication Dylar Dylar One every three days which sounds like its dangerous or habitforming or whatever What does your book say about Dylar Thats just it Its not in there I spent hours There are four indexes It must be recently marketed or go by different names Do you want me to doublecheck No I looked If we could get a pill maybe you could get it analyzed I I dont want to make too much of this We could call her doctor Everybody takes medication Everybody forgets things occasionally Not like my mother I forget things all the time What do you take Uh bloodpressure pills stress pills allergy pills Eyedrops aspirin I looked in your medicine cabinet I thought there might be a new bottle And no Dylar No Well maybe shes done taking it Why dont you wanna believe something might be wrong We have to allow each other to have our secrets dont you think She hides books on the occult in the attic I found them Also I dont think she went to her posture class tonight Why do you say that She went right instead of left at the stop sign Maybe she took the scenic route Thats left too Come on hurry up Plane crash footage a maneuver called a reverse Cuban Eight It was a jet trainer in an air show in New Zealand Theyll show it again did not have enough room to make The plane came down in a field next to the Ball corporation None of the thousands of spectators have been allowed in that area Lets watch a sitcom or something No anit appears the F was coming around anbut not far enough or quickly enough Baba I felt like I was falling through myself Like a heartstopping plunge Someone was here with us Something Its natural Its normal that decent wellmeaning people would find themselves intrigued by catastrophe when they see it on TV Were suffering from brain fade We need an occasional catastrophe to break up the incessant bombardment of information The flows constant Its words pictures numbers Only catastrophe gets our attention We want them This is where California comes in Mud slides brush fires If I were to get you a pill A pill Like a pill Yes a pill Could you analyze it Jack Why do you ask me Youre brilliant Were all brilliant Isnt that the understanding around here You call me brilliant I call you brilliant We call Alfonse brilliant California deserves whatever it gets Californians invented the concept of lifestyle This alone warrants their doom Jack No one calls me brilliant They call me shrewd They say I latched onto something big Youre saying its more or less universal to be fascinated by TV disasters Wheres the pill I have to find it whether to feel good or bad that my experience is widely shared Jack I I need your help establishing an Elvis Presley power base in the department What does Alfonse say He seems to feel Cotsakis has established a prior right Cotsakis was in Memphis when the King died He interviewed members of his entourage Did you take a crap in a toilet bowl that had no seat A great and funky mens room To Cotsakis Elvis is just Elvis But for me Elvis is my Hitler How can I help If you could drop by on my lecture this afternoon lend a note of consequence to the proceedings Your prestige your physical person It would mean a lot Pissing in the snow is also a fetish for me These are the things we dont teach Bowls with no seats pissing in sinks the culture of public toilets Ive pissed in sinks all through the American West Ive slipped across the border to piss in sinks in Manitoba and Alberta Ever had a woman peel flaking skin from your back after a few days at the beach Cocoa Beach Florida It was tremendous Second or third greatest experience of my life Was she naked To the waist From which direction Stop look and listen baby Thats my philosophy Did his mother know that Elvis would die young She talked about assassins She talked about the life The life of a star of this type and magnitude Isnt this life structured to cut you down early This is the point isnt it There are rules guidelines Now I have a feeling about mothers Mothers really do know The folklore is correct Hitler adored his mother He was the first of Klaras children to survive infancy Elvis and Gladys liked to nuzzle and pet They slept in the same bed until he began to approach physical maturity They talked baby talk to each other Hitler was a lazy kid His report card was full of unsatisfactorys Gladys worried about his sleepwalking She lashed out at any kid who would bully him Gladys walked Elvis to school and back every day She defended him in street rumbles But Klara loved him Spoiled him Gave him the attention his father failed to give him Elvis confided in Gladys He brought his girlfriends around to meet her Hitler wrote a poem to his mother He took piano lessons made sketches of museums and villas When Elvis went into the army Gladys became ill and depressed Hitler is what we call a mamas boy Elvis could hardly bear to let Gladys out of his sight As her condition grew worse he kept vigil at the hospital When his mother became severely ill Hitler put a bed in the kitchen to be closer to her Elvis fell apart when Gladys died He cooked and cleaned he wept at the grave Fondled and nuzzled her in the casket Fell into depression and selfpity He talked their baby talk For the rest of his life Hitler couldnt bear Gladyss death caused a fundamental shift died near a Christmas tree Kings world view Years later Elvis began to withdraw deep remoteness into a state of his own dying Hitler put a portrait of his mother in his quarters at Obersalzberg He began to hear a buzzing in his left ear Elvis fulfilled the terms of his contract Excess deterioration selfdestructiveness grotesque behavior a physical bloating and a series of insults to the brain selfdelivered His place in legend is secure He bought off the skeptics by dying early horribly unnecessarily No one could deny him now His mother probably saw it all as on a inch screen years before her own death Picture Hitler near the end trapped in his Fhrerbunker beneath the burning city He looks back to the early days of his power when crowds came Mobs of people overrunning the courtyard singing patriotic songs painting swastikas on the walls on the flanks of farm animals Crowds came to his mountain villa Crowds came to hear him speak Crowds erotically charged the masses he once called his only bride Crowds came to be hypnotized by the voice the party anthems the torchlight parades But wait How familiar this all seems to us How close to ordinary Crowds come get worked up touch and press people eager to be transported Isnt this ordinary We all know this Weve been part of those crowds But there must have been something different about these crowds What was it Let me whisper the terrible word from the Old English from the Old German from the Old Norse Death Death These crowds were assembled in the name of death They were there to attend tributes to the dead But not the already dead The future dead The living dead amongst us Processions songs speeches dialogues with the dead recitations of the names of the dead They were there to see pyres and flaming wheels thousands of flags dipped in salute thousands of uniformed mourners There were ranks and squadrons elaborate backdrops blood banners and black dress uniforms Crowds came to form a shield against their own dying To become a crowd is to keep out death To break off from the crowd is to risk death as an individual to face dying alone Crowds came for this reason above all others They were there to be a crowd May the days be aimless Let the seasons drift Do not advance the action according to a plan Decongestant antihistamine cough suppressants pain reliever Hey What do you see out there The radio said a tank car derailed but I dont think it derailed It got rammed and something punched a hole in it Theres smoke I dont like the looks of it What does it look like You see fire engines or Theyre all over the place It looks to me like theyre not getting too close It must be pretty toxic or pretty explosive stuff It wont come this way How do you know It just wont The point is you shouldnt be standing on ledges It worries Baba You think if you tell me it worries her Ill feel guilty and not do it But if you tell me it worries you Ill do it all the time Shut the window Did you finish your homework Can you see the feathery plume from the attic Its not a plume Will we have to leave Of course not How do you know I just know What about that leak at school and we had to evacuate That was inside This is outside Theyre using leaf blowers to blow stuff onto the spill What kind of stuff I dont know to make the spill harmless Doesnt explain what theyre doing Keeping it from getting bigger When do we eat Dunno If it gets bigger itll get here with or without a wind It wont How do you know Because it wont The radio calls it a feathery plume but its not Thats what Dad says What is it Like a shapeless growing thing A dark black breathing thing of smoke Why do they call it a plume Air time is valuable Have they said what chemical it is Its called Nyodene Derivative or Nyodene D We saw it in a movie in school on toxic waste What does it cause Those videotaped rats It wasnt sure what it does to humans Mainly it was rats growing urgent lumps Thats what the movie said What does the radio say Skin irritation and sweaty palms Sweaty palms in rats The radio not the movie They updated it to nausea vomiting shortness of breath The radio or the movie Both It wont come this way How do you know Because it wont Its calm and still today Wind at this time of year it blows that way not this way What if it blows this way It wont What if just this one time Why should it They closed part of the interstate They would do that Why Why would they They just would Its a sensible precaution Its a way to facilitate movement Hold on Helen Jack is here The Stovers say the spill from the tank car was gallons Her girls were complaining of sweaty palms Theres been a correction They ought to be throwing up Is anyone nauseous Okay okay Thanks Helen Stay in touch The Stovers spoke directly with the weather center outside Glassboro Theyre not calling it a feathery plume anymore What are they calling it A black billowing cloud Thats more accurate Theyre coming to grips with the thing Its good Its expected that some sort of air mass may be moving down from Canada Theres always an air mass moving down from Canada Thats true Theres nothing new in that Since Canada is to the north if the billowing cloud is blown due south itll miss us by a comfortable margin When do we eat Maybe we ought to be more concerned about the cloud I know we dont want to scare the kids Nothing is going to happen I know nothings going to happen you know nothings going to happen but we ought to think about it just in case I mean when do we know when this is real These things happen to people who live in exposed areas Society is set up I mean sadly in such a way that its the poor and uneducated who suffer the main impact of natural and manmade disasters It is sad Did you ever see a college professor rowing a boat down his own street in one of those TV floods Why do you want dinner so early I missed lunch Shall I do some chilifried chicken First rate Wheres Wilder I dont know I ironed your gown Thank you Did you pay the phone bill I cant find it I paid the gas and electricity Lets think about the cloud a little bit okay What if its dangerous Everything in train tank cars is dangerous But the effects are longrange So we die later We dont die Not from this All we have to do is stay out of the way Lets be sure to keep it in the back of our mind Heres Wilder Babas making chilifried chicken Theyre calling it a black billowing cloud Thats what the Stovers said Its good Why is that good I told your sister theyre looking the thing more squarely in the eye Can you spot me Okay Well its still hanging there Looks rooted to the spot Make sure Wilder doesnt get into that insulation So you dont think itll come this way I can tell you know something I dont know Think itll come this way or not You want me to say it wont come this way then youll attack with your data Come here buddy Whatd they say It doesnt cause nausea vomiting shortness of breath like they said before What does it cause Heart palpitations and dj vu Dj vu Come on It affects the false part of the human brain I dont believe that Thats not all Theyre not calling it the black billowing cloud anymore What are they calling it The airborne toxic event Names are not important The important thing is location Its there Were here Wilder A large air mass is moving down from Canada We knew that Doesnt mean its not important Maybe it is maybe it isnt Depends The weathers about to change Arent we eating a little early tonight What do you call early Cause we wanna get it out of the way What do we wanna get out of the way In case something happens Like what This is delicious Baba Youre not eating honey Denise honey are you okay Shes showing outdated symptoms Um Steffie can you Baba could you pass more of the corn Sure Thank you so much Are you feeling better These peppers have a wonderful I think that came from the firehouse Whats for dessert Cloud of deadly chemicals Evacuate all places of residence Cloud of deadly chemicals Cloud of deadly chemicals Evacuate They want us to evacuate They were only making a suggestion or was it a little more mandatory It was a fire captains car In other words you didnt have an opportunity to notice the subtle edges of intonation Due to the sirens The voice said something like Evacuate all places of residence Cloud of deadly chemicals Cloud of deadly chemicals Its okay Jack just leave it Has anyone seen my ski mask I couldnt find my ski mask Why do you need a ski mask It something you take in these kind of things People waste tremendous amounts on motion Im not sure we need the plant but Are we all here Accounted for Everyones gone already Were late Blacksmith residents are to take the parkway to the fourth service area where they would proceed to a restaurant called Kung Fu Palace Is that the place with the lily ponds and the live deer Thats right Where do we go Theyll tell us Can we play my mix Later Was this a mild winter or a harsh winter Compared to what Dont know If youre from the west side This is us head for the Boy Scout camp called Camp Daffodil where Red Cross volunteers will dispense juice and coffee Okay we have a plan Thats Highway after Inersons Ford dealership Oh shit between county line and Interstate We are being asked to stress that you do not attempt to shelter outside your designated cachement The whole point of Sir Albert Einstein is Things should clear up where it turns into four lanes They dont look scared in the Crown Victoria Yeah theyre laughing These guys arent laughing Where In the Country Squire They look devastated What does it matter what theyre doing in other cars I want to know how scared I should be We just dont know at this point That makes me more scared Dont be scared Nobodys coming in the opposite direction Police must have blocked Where are the police Did they leave us on our own Theyre around Why are they shopping during an airborne event Theres a sale Maybe they know something Maybe theres no way out Maybe its raining Nyodene D Is that possible People indoors are being asked to stay indoors Why would they say that We were told to leave you should remain there If you have already evacuated find shelter immediately Again if you are indoors remain indoors If youre not authorities are suggesting you get indoors as soon as possible Theyre passing us Technically thats illegal Baba cooked chilifried chicken for dinner Dads favorite Dad said not to worry the plume will not come this way but it wasnt a plume it was an airborne toxic event We packed in a hurry We ran to the car only to realize we were latecomers to an evacuation Is this everything that happened Rain pelted the roof of our station wagon Pippippip We hit traffic as we left the comfort of sycamores and hedges Dad searched for information on the radio Traffic lined up on the freeway like lightedup dominos We passed by people in distress An unspoken bond with our fellow journeymen formed And then a crash A car flipped on the road People ran to their aid Oh those poor people We were waved by only able to watch in sympathy and awe What Whats that Drive the car Jack I saw your throat contract You swallowed something Just a Life Saver Keep your eyes on the road You place a Life Saver in your mouth and you swallow it without an interval of sucking Swallow what Its still in my mouth You swallowed something I saw That was just saliva I didnt know what to do with Drive the car would you The situations scary I imagine Yes This is a very dangerous chemical were dealing with It could affect a lot of people Do you have any idea how many people in Glassboro have been evacuated Were running out of gas I have no idea Theres always extra How can there be extra Thats how tank is constructed So you dont run out Cant be If you keep going you run out You dont keep going forever How do you know when to stop When you pass a gas station Look No ones here Its working You didnt pay Dad There was nobody there You couldve left money on the counter I was in a hurry I Ill send them a check Yeah but you probably wont do that What happens if the dogs get contaminated Nothing happens to dogs How do you know Ask Jack Ask Heinrich Could be true They use rats to test for things humans can get means we catch the same diseases They wouldnt use dogs if they thought it could hurt them Why not A dog is a mammal So is a rat A rat is a vermin Mostly its a rodent Its also a vermin A cockroach is a vermin A cockroach is an insect You count the legs is how you know Its also a vermin Does a cockroach Family is the cradle of the worlds misinformation than it is like a cockroach even if theyre both vermin Since a rat and a human can get cancer but a cockroach cant What shes saying is two things that are mammals have more in common than two things that are only vermins Are you telling me a rat is not only a vermin and a rodent but a mammal too Oh shit Look at it Look at it Can I see through those Me too Come on kids share Please We are No Ill look first and then No share Actually share Welcome to Camp Daffodil I heard well be able to go home first thing in the morning I dont know if I want to go home My motherinlaws been staying with us This has been a respite Heard it might be two weeks The government knows more The reports are coming in fast and furious And theyre not saying jack shit A helicopter flew into a toxic cloud and completely disappeared I can think of at least seven things that could mean I can think of six whats the seventh Well without knowing the six youre talking about The dogs are in from New Mexico they parachuted into a meadow in a daring night drop Those are real heroes A worldrenowned institute has used hypnosis to induce hundreds of people to recall their previous life experiences as pyramid builders exchange students and extraterrestrials In the last year alone declares reincarnation hypnotist Ling Ti Wan I have helped hundreds to regress to previous lives they sprayed on the big spill was probably soda ash It was a case of too little too late My guess is theyll get some crop dusters up in the air at daybreak and bombard the toxic cloud with lots more soda ash which could break it up and scatter it in a million harmless puffs Soda ash is the common name for sodium carbonate which is used in the manufacture of glass ceramics detergents and soaps Its also what they use to make bicarbonate of soda which is something Im sure a lot of you have guzzled after a night on the town So what youre all probably wondering is what exactly is this Nyodene D we keep hearing about Well Im glad you asked that In powder form its colorless odorless and incredibly dangerous Two looters are dead There have been a bunch of UFO sightings around this area Ronald Reagan Do you know that he was going to be in Casablanca Heinrich seems to be coming out of his shell Wheres he I havent seen him You see that knot of people Dont stand up Hes right in the middle Hes telling them what he knows about the toxic event What does he know Quite a lot it turns out Why didnt he tell us He probably doesnt think its worth his while to be funny and charming in front of his family We present the wrong kind of challenge Dont you think you ought to go there show him his father is there for his big moment Hell get upset if he sees me What if I went over Hell think I sent you Is that so awful Just a Life Saver What Just some saliva you didnt know what to do with It was a Life Saver Give me one It was the last one What flavor Quick Cherry Attention attention If you have been exposed to the airborne toxic event for any amount of time longer than ten seconds proceed to the front Didnt you hear what the voice said Something about exposure Thats right Whats that got to do with us Not us You Why me Werent you the one who got out of the car to fill the gas tank But the airborne event wasnt on top of us then It was ahead of us Remember you got back in the car and there it was in all those lights Beautiful Yes Youre saying when I got out the cloud may have been close enough to rain all over me Its not your fault but you were practically right in it for two and a half minutes How long were you out there Denise said two and a half minutes Is that considered long or short Anything that puts you into skin and orifice contact with the emissions means we have a situation This Nyodene D Congratulations new generation of toxic waste State of the art One part per million can send a rat into a permanent state What about the people in the car I had to open the door to get out and back in Id say their situation is theyre minimal risks Its the two and a half minutes standing right in it which makes me wince What does SIMUVAC stand for Its short for simulated evacuation A new state program theyre battling over funds for This evacuation isnt simulated Its real We know But we thought we could use that as a model Are you saying you saw the chance to use the real event in order to rehearse the simulation We took it right to the streets Hows it going The insertion curve isnt as smooth as wed like We dont have our victims laid out where wed want them if this was an actual simulation Youve to make allowances for the fact that everything tonight is real What about the computers Is that real data youre running through the system or practice stuff You watch I was outside for two and a half minutes The only thing that she was exposed to is good luck Thats how many seconds Im getting bracketed numbers with pulsing stars What does that mean I mean am I going to die Not as such What do you mean Not in so many words How many words does it take Its not a question of words but of years Well know more in years In the meantime we definitely have a situation What will we know in years If youre still alive at that time well know much more than we know now The Nyodene D has a life span of roughly years so youll have made it halfway through To outlive this substance Ill have to make it into my seventies I wouldnt worry about what I cant see or feel Now Id go ahead and live my life Get married settle down have kids Theres no reason you cant do these things knowing what we know But you said we have a situation I didnt The computer did What the computer says is not a simulation despite that armband youre wearing It is real It is real Thank you They want you to think its a train crash but actually its a dirty nuke Murray Youre here Jack Hey big boy All white people have a favorite Elvis song I thought you were going to New York I stayed back to look at car crash movies I heard a rumor about painted women and came out to investigate One of them says she has a snapoff crotch What do you think she means They dont seem busy I dont think this is the kind of disaster that leads to sexual abandon We might get one or two fellows skulking out eventually but there wont be an orgiastic horde not tonight anyway Any episodes of dj vu in your group No Any episodes of dj vu in your group Why do we think these things happened before Simple They did happen before in our minds as visions of the future Supernatural stuff Maybe when we die the first thing well say is I know this feeling I was here before How are you doing Im dying Murray I spent two and a half minutes exposed to the toxic cloud Even if it doesnt kill me in a direct way it will outlive me in my own body I could die in a plane crash and the Nyodene D would be thriving as my remains were laid to rest A computer told me Im truly sorry my friend But computers make mistakes Carpet static can cause a mistake It was in the barrack There was no carpet Lint Hair in the circuits There are always mistakes Not a word to Babette about any of this Shed be devastated Of course Sometimes I actually think I see it coming for me At night usually The thing Ive always feared and now its here Were all aware theres no escape from death And how do we deal with this crushing knowledge We repress we disguise But you dont know how to repress Wish there was something I could do and I could outthink the problem You thought Hitler would protect you Some people are larger than life Hitler is larger than death I understand completely Do you Because I wish I did Its totally obvious The overwhelming horror would leave no room for your own death Its a daring thing you did a daring thrust Daring but dumb If I could just lose interest in myself Here take this I have another one at home in the drawer under my hotplate Heft it around Get the feel Its loaded Its an ittybitty thing but it shoots real bullets Its a caliber Zumwalt automatic Germanmade Up your alley I I dont want it I believe Jack there are two kinds of people in the world Killers and diers Most of us are diers We dont have the dispositions the rage what it takes to be a killer But think how exciting it is in theory to kill a person If he dies you cannot To kill him is to gain lifecredit Who knows Maybe violence is a form of rebirth And maybe you can kill death And they were running because they didnt know what to do The townspeople were scared They were in awe of the cloud it was beautiful above their heads The Nyodene dogs Are here to stay The government knows More than they say UFO sightings in Farmington town Widespread looting all around Three live deer At the Kung Fu Palace are dead Those pretty clouds Aint what they seem See the men in the Mylex suits Coming here to burn and loot Theres no difference Between the blue and the red The cloud is comin for us all Theres no difference Between the blue and the red The cloud is comin One more time Toxic Toxic everywhere Toxic everywhere Jack Jack wake up we have to leave Proceed to your vehicles Mom Mom Five more minutes No more minutes Why does she say everything twice We can hear her She likes to hear herself talk The toxic is coming closer Toxic Toxic It is imperative that you wear your protective face covering Thats a fucking horse Watch out Watch out Watch out Stop stop stop Oh Jack Jack Dad Dad Steffie you lost your Bun Bun What What My bunny Baba I dropped Bun Bun Jack Jack Here Jack Steffie lost her Bun Bun Jack Get Steffies bunny Her bunny She dropped her bunny Over there The keys I need the keys The car keys The keys The keys Everybody get in the car right now Thank you I got it Jack Were going the wrong way Whatre you doing I have a feeling this Land Rover knows how to stay alive Oh my God This isnt a road Okay get down Whoa Headlights at nine oclock On it Oh God Oh my God The lights arent getting any closer Now theyre over there Theyre behind us now Do it Do it Fourteen hundred oclock That is pretty good Were in the water Dad I I realize that now Dad turn off the engine Do sheep have lashes Ask your father Were going sideways Do sheep have lashes Doesnt anyone want to pay attention to whats actually happening Dad wants credit for fording the creek No I dont want credit Forget it go back to your conversation What if there was a waterfall Dad is there a waterfall Oh Turn it back on Floor it Again Could this kill somebody if they got too close to it or is this an irritant Thank you have a builtin appetite for the particular toxic agents in Nyodene D The cloud continues to travel west as residents are now being asked to relocate to Iron City where local businesses have opened their doors to shelter evacuees who have been further displaced from their homes Two of the men from the switching lot are dead with acid visible on their Mylex suits Listen up everybody Hold on lets stop the chatter No one is allowed to leave the building Okay If somebody comes up to me and says Can I leave Im just going to say the same thing Im saying now No one is allowed to leave the building How is Babette I dont like the latest rumor Tell me Theyre lowering in technicians from army helicopters to plant microorganisms in the core of the toxic cloud What dont you like about it I dont know The greater the scientific advance the more scared I get Nothing on network Not a word not a picture On the Glassboro channel we rate words by actual count No film footage No live reports Does this thing happen so often that nobody cares We were scared to death We still are We left our homes Drove through a rainstorm We saw that deadly specter That death ship as it sailed across the sky Are they telling us it was insignificant Do they think this is just television Dont they know its real Shouldnt the streets be crawling with cameras and reporters Shouldnt we be yelling at them Leave us alone Weve been through enough Havent we earned the right to despise their idiot questions Yeah Look at us in this place We are quarantined Yeah We are like lepers in medieval times We are Everything we loved and worked for is under serious threat Even if there hasnt been great loss of life dont we deserve attention for our suffering Our terror Yes Isnt fear news Yes We matter Thats right I saw this before Saw what before You were standing there I was standing here Your features incredibly sharp and clear It all happened before Hissing in the pipes Tiny little hairs standing out in your pores that identical look in your face What look Haunted Ashen Lost It was nine days before they told us we could go back home Welcome back shoppers Its comforting to know the supermarket hasnt changed since the toxic event In fact the supermarket has only gotten better Between the unpackaged meat and the fresh bread its like a Persian bazaar Everything is fine and will continue to be fine as long as the supermarket doesnt slip Do you know the Tibetans believe theres a transitional state between death and rebirth Thats what I think when I come here The supermarket is a waiting place It recharges us spiritually Its a gateway Look how bright Look how full of psychic data waves and radiation All the letters and numbers are here all the colors of the spectrum all the voices and sounds all the code words and ceremonial phrases We just have to know how to decipher it Whoa Oh jeez Hows that lovely woman of yours Shes been different somehow since the event Weve suffered a collective trauma She wears her sweatsuit all the time She stares out of windows and cries for no reason I dont know how to help her Ive been distracted preparing for the Hitler conference And the kids Back in school Steffie no longer wears her protective mask And you Ive got another doctors appointment tomorrow What does he say about your status as a doomed man I havent told him Since he hasnt found anything wrong Im not going to bring it up I lie to doctors all the time So do I But why Do you know the Elvis struggle you helped me with It turns out tragically I wouldve won anyway What happened Cotsakis my rival is no longer in the land of the living Hes Dead Lost in the surf off Malibu During term break I found out an hour ago came right here Im sorry to tell you Particularly because of your condition Poor Cotsakis Lost in the surf That enormous man He was big all right Enormously so He mustve weighed pounds Oh Easily Dead A big man like that Its better not knowing them when they die but better them than us To be so enormous Then to die I can picture him so clearly Maybe once we stop denying death we can proceed calmly to die We simply walk toward the sliding doors Now Cool Crush Jolt HiC Nancy Senca Senca Nancy What if death is nothing but sound You hear it forever Sound all around Uniform white Its strange in a way isnt it That we can picture the dead Disregard last announcement Disregard Hold on what Oh regard Why so many checkups Mr Gladney In the past you were always afraid to know if anything was wrong Im still afraid Well Im glad youre finally taking your status as patient seriously My status Once people leave the doctors office they tend to forget that they are patients But a doctor doesnt cease being a doctor at close of day Neither should patient I dont like your potassium very much at all Whats that mean There isnt time to explain We have true elevation and false elevation Thats all you need to know Exactly how elevated is my potassium Its gone through the roof evidently Could this potassium be an indication of some condition just beginning to manifest itself Some condition caused perhaps by an exposure an involuntary spillageintake some substance say in the air or rain Have you come in contact with such a substance Were you exposed to that cloud Why Do the numbers show some sign of possible exposure If you havent been exposed then they couldnt show a sign could they Then we agree And youd have no reason to lie to me Im going to send you to Glassboro for further tests They have a brandnew facility called Autumn Harvest Farms Have you heard of it They have gleaming new equipment It gleams absolutely Tell them to send you back to me with sealed results Together as doctor and patient we can do things that neither of us could do separately Uh Dr Lu have you heard of Dylar Is that an island in the Persian Gulf No its a Oil terminals crucial to the survival of the West Something that comes in a little white tablet Never heard of it Life is slowly but surely returning to normal here in Blacksmith and the surrounding areas Im told German shepherds have sniffed out only a very low level of toxic material on the edge of town But there is no more danger posed to humans or animals The last of the emergency personnel are packing up and taking the dogs with them The real issue is the radiation that surrounds us every day Your radio your TV your microwave oven the powerlines outside your door Forget toxic clouds Its the electrical and magnetic fields Industry would collapse if the true results of any of these investigations were released Is Wilder talking less now If they release the findings thered be billions of dollars in lawsuits Thats a little extreme Whats extreme what I said or whatd happen Why are mountains upstate Mountains are always upstate Say more The snow melts as planned in the spring and flows down to the reservoirs near the cities which are kept in the lower end for this reason Is that true What do you think I honestly dont know Kids listen to me Hold hands when you cross the street Be careful around swimming pools If you think someone is a kidnapper they probably are Where are you going They gave me a new class at the church In what Eating and drinking Isnt that obvious Whats there to teach Isnt it kind of late Its almost night What is night It happens seven times a week Where is the uniqueness in this Jack can you help me with my homework after dinner Homework was a canard I wanna show you something Dylar There were four left Take one for proof We need physical evidence We say nothing to Baba All right Shell say she doesnt remember why she put them there Ill go to the drugstore in the morning and ask the pharmacist about Dylar I already did that When Around Christmas I went to three drugstores Whatd they say Never heard of it Its not on any list Unlisted We have to call her doctor Ill call him tomorrow Call him now This is serious Jack Something is wrong with her Ill call him now Ill call him at home Surprise him If I get him at home I wont be screened by a receptionist Call him at home Wake him up Trick him into telling us what we wanna know Ill call him at home Wake him up Trick him into telling us what we wanna know Hello Dr Hookstratten This is Jack Gladney you treat my wife Babette Okay Im sorry to call you at home but Im concerned about Babette And Im pretty sure the medication you prescribed is causing the problem What problem Memory lapse You would call a doctor at home to talk about memory lapse If everyone with memory lapse called a doctor at home what would we have The ripple effect would be tremendous They are frequent the lapses Frequent and prolonged You would call a doctor at ten oclock at night you would say to him memory lapse Why not tell me she has gas Call me at home for gas Frequent and prolonged doctor It has to be the medication What medication Dylar Dylar Never heard of it A small white tablet Comes in an amber bottle Comes in an amber You would describe a tablet as small and white and expect a doctor to respond at home after at night Why not tell me it is round This is crucial to our case Its an unlisted drug I never saw it I certainly never prescribed it for your wife Okay Sorry to bother you Tell him I went to three pharmacies Im never in control of what I say to doctors I will take the tablet and have it analyzed by someone at the chemistry department at the school Unless youve already done that too Its not a tablet in the old sense The medication in Dylar is encased in a polymer membrane Water from your gastrointestinal tract seeps through the membrane at a carefully controlled rate What does the water do It dissolves the medication encased in the membrane The medicine then passes out of the polymer tablet through a single small hole It took me a while to spot the hole Thats because its laserdrilled Its not only tiny but stunningly precise in its dimensions Lasers Polymers Im not an expert in any of this Jack but I can tell you its a wonderful little system Ah Twinkie Whats the point of all this precision The drug is delivered at specified rates over extended periods of time The system is efficient Im impressed Im even dazzled Now tell me what this medication is designed to do What is Dylar I dont know Of course you know Youre brilliant Everyone says so What else can they say I do neurochemistry No one knows what that is All I can tell you for certain is the substance contained in Dylar is some kind of psychopharmaceutical Its probably designed to interact with a distant part of the human cortex I wish I knew more But I can tell you this Its not on the market I found it in an ordinary prescription vial I dont care where you found it This is unknown Its time for a major dialogue You know it I know it We found the Dylar What Dylar Come on Baba It was taped to the radiator cover Why would I tape something to the radiator cover Thats exactly what Denise predicted you would say Shes usually right Youll tell me all about Dylar If not for my sake then for your little girls Shes been worried Worried sick Besides you have no more room to maneuver Weve backed you against the wall I had one of the tablets analyzed by an expert Dylar is almost as ingenious as the microorganisms that ate the billowing cloud We know something else something crucially damaging to your case We know Dylar is not available to the general public As you well know I dont have the temperament to hound people But Denise is a different kind of person If you dont tell me what I want to know Ill unleash your little girl Shell come at you with everything she has Shell hammer you right into the ground You know Im right Babette Just let me tell it in my own way Take your time Weve got all day Ill be right here for as long as it takes I dont know exactly when it started Maybe a year and a half ago I thought I was going through a phase Some kind of watermark period in my life Landmark or watershed A kind of settlingin I thought Middle age Something like that The condition would go away and Id forget about it but it didnt What condition Never mind that for now Ive never seen you like this This is the whole point of Babette She is a joyous person She doesnt succumb to gloom or selfpity Let me tell it Jack All right You know how I am I think everything is correctable Given the right attitude a person can change a harmful condition by reducing it to its simplest parts I went to libraries and bookstores watched cable TV made lists and diagrams talked to a holy Sikh man in Iron City Even studied the occult hiding the books in the attic so you and Denise wouldnt find them and wonder what was going on All this without my knowing The whole point of Babette is that she speaks to me she reveals and confides This is not a story about your disappointment in my silence The theme of this story is my pain and my attempts to end it Okay I did all this research but I was getting nowhere The condition hung over my life Then one day at the supermarket I was reading a tabloid in line There was an ad Never mind exactly what it said Volunteers wanted for secret research This is all you have to know I answered the ad and was interviewed by a small firm doing research in psychobiology Lets call the company Gray Research although thats not the true name Lets call my contact Mr Gray Mr Gray is a composite I was eventually in touch with three or four or more people at the firm One of those long low pale brick buildings with electrified fencing and lowprofile shrubbery I never saw their headquarters Never mind why The point is I took test after test Emotional psychological motor response brain activity Mr Gray said there were three finalists and I was one of them Finalists for what We were to be test subjects in the development of a superexperimental and topsecret drug Code name Dylar Aha Hed found a Dylar receptor in the human brain and was putting the finishing touches on the tablet itself I felt hopeful for the first time in so long But there were many dangers in running tests on humans Among other things it could cause death Or I could live but my brain could die Or I could not distinguish words from things so that if someone said speeding bullet Id fall to the floor and take cover In the end it just made me forget things And they let you go ahead anyway a human test animal No they didnt They finally said it was all too risky Legally ethically so forth Well thats good No I refused to accept this I want you to try to understand what happened next If Im going to tell you this story I have to include this aspect of it this grubby little corner of the human heart You say Babette reveals and confides This is the point of Babette Good I will reveal and confide But you dont want to know what happened You think you do but you dont Mr Gray and I made a private arrangement We would conduct the experiments on our own I would be cured of my condition and he would be acclaimed for a wonderful medical breakthrough Okay It involved an indiscretion It It was the only way I could get Mr Gray to let me use the drug It was my last resort my last hope First Id offered him my mind Now I offered my body How do you offer your body to a composite of three or more people This is a compound person Lets concentrate on the genitals How many sets are we talking about Just one person Jack A key person the project manager So we are no longer referring to the Mr Gray who is a composite He is now one person We went to a grubby little motel room Never mind where or when It had It had the TV up near the ceiling This is all I remember I was so ashamed I wore a ski mask to cover my face You call this an indiscretion You traded sex for pills Jack You walked barefoot on the fireretardant carpet Mr Gray put his car rental keys on the dresser and he entered you Please dont use that term You know how I feel about that word He effected what is called entry In other words he inserted himself inside you No one was inside anyone I did what I had to do I was remote I was outside of myself It was a capitalist transaction You cherish your wife who tells you everything I am doing my best to be that person Im only trying to understand How many times did you go to this motel More or less on a continuing basis for some months That was the agreement Did Did you enjoy having sex with him I I only I only remember the TV up near the ceiling aimed down at us Did he have a sense of humor I know women appreciate men who can joke about sex I cant unfortunately And after this I dont think theres much chance Ill be able to learn Its better if you know him as Mr Gray Thats all Hes not tall short young or old He doesnt laugh or cry Its for your own good No you have to tell me who he is No How do I know you wont kill him Because Im not a killer Youre a man Jack We all know about men and their insane jealous rage This is something men are very good at Im not good at that I I twirl garbage bags and twisttie them I Is this still going on No Why not Because the drug didnt work At least on me Maybe I should go Get a hotel room or I dont know I dont know No No Youve taken me this far put me through this much I have to know Whats the condition Im afraid to die Im afraid of my death You Youre still young You run up and down the stadium steps This is not a reasonable fear I I just cant believe that were all marching towards nonexistence All of us It haunts me Jack It wont go away Baba everyone fears death But Mr Gray said I was extra sensitive to it that I fear it right up front Thats why he was eager to use me Baba Im the one in this family who is obsessed by death I have always been the one I love you I just fear death more than I love you And I really really love you Theres something I promised myself I wouldnt tell you Im tentatively scheduled to die It wont happen tomorrow or the next day But its in the works So we are no longer talking about fear and floating terror This is the hard and heavy thing the fact itself Apparently in the amount of time that it took me to walk from my door to the gas station pump I was exposed to enough chemicals in the air that Imagining yourself dead is one of the cheapest sleaziest most satisfying forms of childish selfpity How much pleasure did you take as a kid in imagining yourself dead I still imagine my death Whenever Im upset about something I imagine all my friends relatives and colleagues theyre all gathered around my casket They are very sorry they werent nicer to me while I lived Children are very good at selfpity which must mean its natural and important Theres something more childish and satisfying than selfpity something that explains why I try to see myself dead regularly Death disease outer space Its all much clearer here Start your breakfast thats what it comes down to A person spends his life saying goodbye to others But how does he say goodbye to himself Show me your tongue We are awaiting your lecture Panasonic The kids are real fond at my house of pepperoni so Im going to throw on some pepperoni slices here Cooked ham or sausage This is a great way to get rid of leftovers Anything you have in the refrigerator is fair game for a sandwich at least it is at my house I have some mozzarella cheese here well just load that up in the center What are you doing Dont worry Its only me I know who it is I know what youre looking for What did you do with the bottle There were three tablets left How do you know I took it I know it You know it If somebody wants to tell me what Dylar is well get somewhere Your mother no longer takes the medication Your reason for holding the bottle its not valid anymore Tell me what it does and Ill give it to you Okay I had a recent scare I thought something awful was about to happen It turned out I was wrong thank goodness But there are lingering effects I need the Dylar Whats the problem Isnt that enough to know the problem exists I dont want to be tricked Theres no question of tricking I just need the medication Youll give them to my mother who I think stole my ski mask by the way Is she a drug addict You know thats not true You two arent going to get divorced are you Why would you ask that Youre sleeping on the pullout Its uncomfortable We are talking about death I fear it And the tablets probably dont work but maybe they will in me Even if they dont it doesnt matter what they are Im eager to be humored Isnt that a little stupid This is what happens to desperate people You remember you heard on the radio the billowing cloud caused sweaty palms and then your palms got sweaty didnt they The power of suggestion makes some people sick and other people well If I think it will help me it will help me I threw the bottle away No you didnt Where I put it in the garbage compactor When A few days ago Hello Id like to buy some Dylar Rid the fear Rid the fear Clear the grid The Roadway Motel in Germantown Room Yes Yes Go go go yep Great speech Jack You drank a lot of water Dad Dont wait up for me tonight But I need the car I have my class You take the car I dont need our car Theres a chill in the air You know what a chill in the air means What does it mean Wear your ski mask I never realized there was so much to say about Hitlers dog Elvis loved dogs too There was Woodlawn and Muffy Dee and Champagne Also Muffin And Wendell but of course Wendell was a cat Murray I need your car keys Okay Steal instead of buy Shoot instead of talk Youre a man Jack We all know about men and their insane jealous rage Steal instead of buy Shoot instead of talk Maybe violence is a form of rebirth And maybe you can kill death Some fellows make a winning sometime I never even Are you heartsick or soulsick Believe me Im always chasing rain I know you Yes Ive been around Im the chick and the cheese Um Where was I Im always chasing rain What do you want I want some Dylar Waiting to find a little bluebird What do you want I want to live But you are dying But I dont want to Then we agree To enter a room is to agree on a certain kind of behavior It isnt a street or a parking lot for instance The point of rooms is that they are inside Good point There is an unwritten agreement between the person who enters the room and the person whose room has been entered A room is inside That is what people in rooms have to agree on as differentiated from lawns meadows fields orchards That makes perfect sense To convert Fahrenheit to Celsius this is what you do I wasnt always as you see me now Thats what I was thinking I was doing important work I envied myself Death without fear is an everyday thing You can live with it Are you saying theres no death as we know it without the element of fear People would adjust to it Dylar failed reluctantly With everybody With all bodies But it will definitely come Maybe now maybe never Eventually there will be an effective medication youre saying Just between us chicken I eat this stuff like candy I was just thinking that How much do you want to buy How much do I need Youre a big man Middle age Does this describe your anguish I see you as a person with your darkbrown leather jacket champagnecolored pants Tell me how correct I am I learned my English watching American TV I I barely forget the time I had in this room before I became misplaced There was a woman in a ski mask but her name escapes me at the moment American sex Let

in the world In Escobar died in a hail of bullets on a rooftop in Medellin Colombias second city Plenty of people claim to have pulled the trigger Hugo speaks in foreign language Others fervently deny any implication Murphy This was a Colombian national police solo operation Fitzharris Im going to explore the curious life of this powerful drug lord and look for answers in his extremely curious death bewitching music continues Im Dr Lindsey Fitzharris Im a medical historian and bestselling author with a PhD in the history of science and medicine from Oxford University Ive written about the pioneering days of surgery about syphilis plagues and pandemics and even books made of human skin Some might say Im obsessed with the macabre and with death but I think the way people die tells us a whole lot about how they lived Im going to explore some of historys most famous lives by looking at them through their extremely curious deaths This is my investigation room and here is my science lab where Dr Raychelle Burks will be doing tests and experiments for me And here is where my crime solving partner former Scotland Yard detective Brian Hook helps me piece together my investigations Call it biography with a twist a biography from the morgue spooky music skull laughs menacingly hushed music In the s and s across America and Europe one drug defines the party scene more than any other cocaine It becomes the drug of choice for the rich and famous Rock stars Wall Street tycoons Hollywood actors theyre all rolling up the dollar bills and snorting this highly addictive white powder like theres no tomorrow And theres one man in particular responsible for supplying the cocaine blizzard on American streets multibilliondollar Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar Pablo in foreign language By the time hes shot down in hes made a host of powerful enemies at home and abroad Finding out who fired the kill shot matters If he was shot by the Colombian police it could be seen as some kind of justice if by a rival gang its a straightforward murder and if it was a foreign power its a breach of international law Im going to unravel who was present that day and through the lens of his last moments explore the life of the most influential drug lord in history The young Pablo Escobar grew up in what is best described as a war zone We met up with a former policeman Carlos Palau who lived through the Escobar years in Medellin Fitzharris Journalist Rodrigo Martinez reported on Escobars reign of terror Rodrigo speaks in foreign language Fitzharris Escobar chooses bad After his teenage years as a petty crook he graduates to drug running and hes good at it By the time hes hes said to be the seventh richest man in the world and cocaine is his business threatening music Cocaine paid for Escobars vast empire It comes from the leaves of the South American coca plant For thousands of years the original inhabitants of the area chewed the coca leaf to feel its energetic high Cocaine was first used as an anesthetic in the th Century With the introduction of it into Western medicine came rising rates of addiction and overdoses Even the renowned neurologist Sigmund Freud became an addict once treating a patient for stomach pains and depression by filling her nose with grams of cocaine to cauterize it enchanting music continues Unsurprisingly the results were catastrophic but what we all wanna know is did CocaCola once contain cocaine Despite vigorous company denials historical evidence suggests otherwise In the Atlanta pharmacists John Pemberton had a bright idea of mixing his coca leaf extract with sugar syrup adding kolanut extract for an extra hit of caffeine Voila CocaCola was born But by public opinion on the drug had changed prompting CocaCola to remove nearly all the cocaine from the beverage However it wasnt until when scientists were able to completely remove the psychoactive elements from the coca leaf extract that it became completely cocaine free The rest as they say is history menacing music The cocaine trade might have formed Escobars income but he went on to use his extreme wealth to create political influence imperious music continues Rodrigo speaks in foreign language Hes a hero not just to the poor and the dispossessed in Colombia but also to his family We secured this revealing interview with his son Juan Pablo Escobar who was years old when his father was shot dead Now known as Sebastian Marroquin he agreed to talk to us about Pablo Marroquin The first time I realize who my father was it was because he told me I remembered I had like a seven eight years old He just sent somebody to kill the Minister of Justice So the next day he told me Hey son I am a bandit and this is what I do for a living Since that day I realize and I understood what my father used to do Fitzharris In he agrees to a truce to avoid extradition to the US and hes given his own luxurious prison but after just months of incarceration Escobar pulls off an audacious escape and goes on the run Reporter The manhunt for Pablo Escobar intensifies Crack police units are raiding suspected safe houses where the billionaire drug lord could be hiding out Fitzharris A special police team Search Bloc was formed to hunt him down News archive Pablo Escobar is without a doubt the most powerful and ruthless of all the drug bosses Fitzharris But on December nd police descended on a suburban street in Medellin Theres a shootout and the manhunt for Pablo Escobar is finally over The US Drug Enforcement Agency arrived within minutes Steve Murphy who became famous as the model for the DEA agent in the hit TV series Narcos was quickly at the scene I managed to get a phone call with him Fitzharris When drug lord Pablo Escobar is shot dead in a raid on his hideout everyone wants to be the hero who fired the killer bullet Former murder detective Brian Hook worked for Scotland Yard in London for years Its a world away from Colombia but Brian does know a thing or two about catching extremely dangerous individuals haunting music Lets get some visual references of who was at the shootout starting with the Steve Murphy photos Wow these photos are quite gruesome but they have become iconic images of Pablo Escobars death Hook Well theyre the guys from the Search Bloc whove raided Pablos house Then we have Hugo Aguilar their leader that morning Fitzharris Carlos Palau takes us back to the scene of the crime to help us piece together what happened during the shootout Rodrigo speaks in foreign language Reporter Pablo Escobar probably the worlds most wanted man is gunned down Thursday in Medellin Residents Pablo Pablo Reporter Local residents chanted his name as Escobars body was lowered from the rooftop where he had been killed Rodrigo speaks in foreign language Residents Pablo Pablo Pablo Pablo Pablo Pablo Fitzharris Pedro Morales has performed thousands of autopsies and has almost years experience working as a pathologist in Colombia He took us to the morgue where Pablo Escobars autopsy was performed gloomy music Pedro speaks in foreign language bitter music Thats really helpful There were three shots One to the leg one to the back and one to the head three wounds but who fired the three weapons and which was the fatal bullet bewitching music continues I think its time to meet Pablo menacing music I have some tests I wanna do on his body so I have my Pablo replica here creepy music Under that familiar image of an indestructible drug lord is a body which reacts just like the rest of us Hes made out of ballistic gel which performs in the same way as the human body when shot If were going to find out who killed Pablo Escobar we need to find out which of the three gunshots was the one that killed him and who had their hand on the trigger Francs Fire Fitzharris We know that bullets took down drug lord Pablo Escobar but we dont know what weapons were used to fire the shots For every gun there is a bullet and putting the two together might help us solve the shooting threatening music Fitzharris Escobars legacy was a river that ran with the blood of more than victims who are shot between and He died as he lived by the bullet but how can we determine which gun took the kill shot Its one for a subspecialism forensic ballistics This is the process of matching a specific firearm to a bullet by test firing the presumed weapon with a new slug and comparing both bullets under a microscope And this specialty has a longer history than you might think It began in England in when Scotland Yard detective Henry Goddard connected a bullet to a murder weapon for the first time in history But forensic ballistics was limited in those earlier periods because of the lack of equipment to enable side by side comparisons of bullets As it stood an investigator would have to examine one bullet under a microscope while retaining a mental image of the second bullet This led to obvious blunders and wrongful convictions but a breakthrough occurred in the s When a group of scientists built an instrument consisting of two microscopes connected by an optical bridge Surprisingly it was another Goddard American Army Colonel Calvin Hooker Goddard who used the comparison microscope to solve one of the most infamous crimes of the th Century He examined bullet casings to prove that the guns used to murder seven people in the Saint Valentines Day massacre was not policeissued weapons concluding it mustve been a mob hit Colonel Goddards victory earned him the title the father of forensic ballistics menacing music We have a lotta ballistics detail from the Escobar autopsy report to help us out in this gunshot killing Hook Gunshot wounds are interesting They can actually give us lots of information This first wound to the back of the leg the interesting thing about this is the exit wound by centimeters What that indicates is a highvelocity assault rifle round monstrous music Fitzharris My chief investigator Brian Hook is a specialist in ballistics Hook Yeah Yeah yeah thats perfect Fitzharris So Ive asked him to take our dummy made from specialist ballistics gel to a firing range Hes testing the weapons he believes were used in the raid on Escobars hideout with expert marksman Noel Francs Hook The shot were after is the back of the left thigh Lets give it a go Fitzharris Brian has asked Noel to use the Galil an Israeli automatic rifle that fires a millimeter round the same weapon used by the Colombian police Francs Three two one fire Hook Weve got an entry wound here and its gone straight through Thats consistent with the postmortem reports So I think its safe to say that its highly likely that that was the galil Fitzharris This tells us that the bullet through Escobars leg could well have been shot from a distance with the Galil assault rifle Lets look at the second wound Hook The entry wound to the shoulder is by centimeters We know that the round was found at the bottom of the left jaw Thats probably a handgun If that was the galil that would go straight the way through Fitzharris For the second wound Brian is testing a pistol that fires a nine millimeter round The gel dummy has to be laid at an angle for this shot because of the trajectory of the bullet through Escobars body Francs I can get the trajectory towards more or less the jaw so we have the right angle Whether it will lodge or wont lodge we wont really know till after we test Hook Post shooting Fitzharris The gun must have been shooting upwards towards Escobars back Francs Gun hot Ready to fire aggravated music Hook Somewhere in the skull is the round It hasnt actually exited Could just as easily have wound up underneath the left jaw as it did with Pablo We know that the SIG SAUER nine millimeter was being used Fitzharris Thats the kinda gun that Hugo Aguilar had Hook Exactly right The interesting thing here is that thats also the handgun that Pablo Escobar had Fitzharris We just have the third wound now to test the one that went through Escobars right ear Hook If you look at the third wound the entry is by centimeters That is a classic ninemillimeterround entry wound Fitzharris Thats interesting Hook The exit wounds slightly bigger two centimeters by one centimeter Fitzharris To create this wound the most likely weapon would have been the nine millimeter SIG SAUER again Brian is testing the theory with noel Francs Fire Hook Another good shot in the ear exactly the same place as happened with Pablo Yeah if we look at the entry wound here and the exit wound theyre roughly the same size as reported on the postmortem So think its safe to say that thats the nine millimeter Fitzharris With this new evidence from the firing range we can now plot what happened on that roof when Escobar was gunned down bewitching music continues We know that none of the gunmen were on the roof with Escobar when he was shot So this bullet must have either been fired from the window behind Escobar or from the street below using the Galil gunshot bangs Escobar is hit in the leg Carrying a leg wound Escobar crawls along the roof with his back to the wall and is shot for a second time gunshot bangs Either from the window or the street gunshot bangs The bullet hits him in his back through his right shoulder We now know this is a nine millimeter pistol probably a SIG SAUER gunshot bangs One bullet hits Escobars head also from a nine millimeter pistol directly into his right ear Every bullet tells a story perhaps in Escobars case a different story What Id like to know is whether the shot to his right ear was fired when Escobar was already dead from the bullet in his back Ive asked Dr Judy Melinek to have a look at the autopsy report Shes a forensic pathologist who certainly knows a thing or two about autopsies haunting music She has pronounced on over cases including many fatal shootings Shes using the skull from inside our gel dummy to show the passage of the bullet through Escobars head rugged music continues Dr Melinek in reviewing the autopsy report which shot killed him Melinek There were three shots to the body but the one that killed him was the one that went into his head It came in at the right side of the temple over the ear This would be an inwardly beveled meaning that the bone is forced into the brain right here at the right temple Then it wouldve come out on the other side of the head You could see that the bone is pushed out or whats called outwardly beveled Then the disruption to the brain caused fractures to the back that damaged the cerebellum and the brainstem The brainstem controls the heart and lungs so when thats damaged its an instantaneous death gunshot bangs Fitzharris The shot through the ear finally immobilizes Escobar Now we need to know who was actually on the scene at the shootout Its not as clearcut as you might think At the time the Colombian authorities were under intense pressure from the mayhem caused by the narcoeconomy siren wails Pablo Escobar is ruthless and brutal despairing music continues In his year reign of terror he doesnt only kill rival drug dealers he assassinates a presidential candidate downs an airplane carrying innocent civilians and even takes the lives of children when he bombs a bookshop in Medellin In Escobars hometown suffers over gangland deaths and unrivaled murder rates Former stockbroker Shaun Attwood knows the drug world from the inside In he got a year sentence in the US for drug dealing but since his release hes written a number of books on crime including a bestseller on Escobar Attwood Colombia was a narcoeconomy The black market in drugs gets bigger every single year and every profession that money comes into contact with it corrupts It corrupts judges It corrupts police It corrupt politicians It even corrupted presidents desolate music Fitzharris Police officer Carlos Palau remembers it well Fitzharris With the Colombian police under such intense pressure a new shadowy gang forms with their own reasons for wanting Escobar dead Los Pepes Attwood Los Pepes stands for people persecuted by Pablo Escobar The death squad recruited people whod suffered at Pablos hands people whove lost family members people in the police whod lost colleagues people in the Colombian military The Search Bloc was so upset and traumatized by all of their members had been killed by Pablo they wanted him dead at all costs so the pepes then allied with the Search Bloc Fitzharris We know that the American Drug Enforcement Agency was active in the manhunt for Escobar It had to navigate a careful path working in a foreign sovereign country in what was clearly a complicated and dangerous world Agent Steve Murphy was there every step of the way and told me just how deadly it was murky music Fitzharris It sounds like a murky world The cops are criminals and the criminals are cops Knowing who fired the deadly shot isnt just about different gunman within the police Were talking about possible criminal elements working with the police This gets to the very heart of the problems in s Colombian society Hook Its certainly public knowledge that Los Pepes were working with the Search Bloc and going on the raid and doing everything the police were doing Fitzharris But were Los Pepes involved on the raid on Pablos hideouts Hook Well lots of people claim to be there but theres certainly no photographic evidence of them But from my research their leader Don Berna certainly had access to exactly the same weapons as the Search Bloc the Galil and the SIG SAUER Fitzharris So it coulda been someone from Los Pepes who fired the killer bullet Now we have Los Pepes on our suspect list and Search Bloc And heres yet one more Attwood The kill shot was so precise it caused a lot of speculation that snipers may have been out there firing those shots Fitzharris Evidence suggests that the chief suspects of the shootout that killed Pablo Escobar were the police Search Bloc and the vigilante group Los Pepes But there is one other possibility we have to look at Our research has revealed that Delta Force were an elite US Special Forces outfit working with the Colombian police in the hunt for Escobar They had highly skilled snipers within their ranks Rumors that they were present at the shootout were fueled by the politics of the time Attwood George HW Bush made Pablo Escobar his main bogeyman in the war on drugs All of the resources of the US Federal Government were thrown after Pablo including the CIA including the DEA They sent over Special Forces Delta Force snipers and various other entities Fitzharris What do we know about the kinds of guns the US snipers were using at this time Hook Well the Delta Force used this rifle there Thats a Remington The military version was called the M That weapon fires a caliber round which is smaller than the ninemillimeter round fired by the SIG SAUER but its bigger than the round the Galil fires threatening music continues Fitzharris If a US sniper fired an M what kind of damage to Escobars head would it have done Brian and noel are going to find out Hook Okay Francs Three two one fire aching music Hook This is the result of the sniper rifle shot from about meters As you can see from the exit wound theres massive damage there Fitzharris Wow thats huge Hook The exit wound on Pablo was one centimeter by two centimeters That is far far bigger Fitzharris Yeah and I think because of this we can discount the sniper rifle Hook Absolutely agree Fitzharris Our ballistics are backed up by Steve Murphy Fitzharris We are now down to two sets of suspects and one gun The hunt for Escobar reaches a peak in the last months of Despite the best intelligence and equipment that America could provide the Colombian authorities with Escobar has been evading capture for months He was a past master at keeping hidden sneaky music continues Marroquin My father had to invent a lot of a security measures to maintain his safety I remember my father saying to me every day Dont ever use a phone If you touch your phone youre dead Phone is death You have to know this son Fitzharris Throughout his career Escobar used a variety of communications to keep his movements secret some of them very creative Marroquin He use pigeons to communicate Doesnt matter the place you tied the message and you send the pigeon and they will come threatening music Fitzharris Escobar wasnt the first to use our feathered friends to send vital communications In the First World War the carrier pigeon Cher Ami was awarded a military medal for delivering a vital message at the Battle of Verdun despite being shot through the breast and losing an eye and a leg Shes honored and stuffed in the Smithsonian National Museum of American History Other animals have played vital roles during war time The US military has even employed the help of aquatic animals to outsmart the enemy In scientists in the Navy Marine Mammal Program found that dolphins were adept at delivering messages and identifying threats In the Vietnam War the dolphins were used to discourage enemy swimmers from attacking a key ammunition pier More recently in nine US navy dolphins identified mines in an Iraqi port on the Persian gulf That operation was the first case of marine animals clearing mines in a war zone For sure we owe a great debt to our fishy furry and feathered friends menacing music Despite Escobars use of pigeon post eventually the net closed in on him and on December nd he was found Its time to put together everything we now know about the bullets and the wounds The prime candidate would be someone from the Search Bloc the elite team of cops whod been hunting Escobar for over a year The leader of the Search Bloc Hugo Aguilar claimed in his book So I killed Pablo Escobar that he personally shot the drug lord hateful music continues We discovered this intriguing interview he gave to a Portuguese journalist Hugo speaks in foreign language Hook What Hugo is saying is two shots were fired one by him using his pistol the SIG SAUER and that went in the back of Pablo and his friend using an R rifle shot him in the right ear that exited out the left ear Well we know from the size of the wounds that cant be true That is not a wound caused by a rifle Thats caused by a ninemillimeter pistol So Hugo is either wrong or lying Fitzharris Our ballistics evidence clearly undermines Aguilars account of the shooting and his credibility as a witness is further challenged when several years later hes given a nineyear jail sentence on a separate corruption charge There is little about Aguilars story that can be taken at face value All right good job youve convinced me Brian We can cross Hugo Aguilar off our list With Aguilar outta the way we now need to investigate the vigilante gang made up of Escobars most sworn enemies Los Pepes Fitzharris Were narowing down the suspects of who pulled the trigger that killed Pablo Escobar The next on my list is the vigilante gang Los Pepes Hook Their leader Don Berna he actually claims that he was on the raid when Pablo was shot In actual fact he claims his brother Rodolfo was the man that actually shot Pablo Fitzharris Steve Murphys partner in Colombia Javier Pea joined our phone call He has an extremely interesting theory about Los Pepes involvement in Escobars death Fitzharris So according to Javier Pea the killer bullet could well have been fired by Los Pepes but it was hushed up on the day But theres no photographic proof The story might well have stopped there but theres something that happened in Pablo Escobars family petitioned to open up his grave to examine his remains and they filmed it The Escobar family was in the grips of a paternity suit and wanted to secure Pablos DNA Im not so interested in the paternity suit but I am interested to see the body especially the skull Nicholas Escobar talks us through the family film of the event Nicholas speaks in foreign language desolate music Fitzharris You cant really see much of the skull at all can you Hook Not really evidentially theres not a lot we can see at all We certainly cant see any of the entry wound on the right side of the skull Its just covered in soil Fitzharris Its very unhelpful I wish they had been a little bit more thorough with the exhumation Hook Yeah it woulda been helpful Fitzharris There isnt any new evidence from the exhumation but a brand new theory comes to light from Escobars own son We know the fatal shot isnt from a US sniper rifle or a police assault rifle but it could be from either a Search Bloc or Los Pepes handgun This is what Sebastian thinks happened on that rooftop Marroquin He told me that he was going to do it Sunday that any day he felt surrounded he will do it For me and the information we have its absolutely a fact that my father decided to commit suicide Fitzharris Suicide this is interesting Could it be true What do the experts think Pedro speaks in foreign language Tattooing is what forensic pathologists call the marks left by a bullet when it is fired near to the skin whats called close range threatening music I asked Brian and Noel to fire one more test shot at the dummy head Hook What Id like you to do is to shoot this head for me from close range with a nine millimeter Lets have a look see what happens Francs Okay Hook Yeah its just as I thought look Francs A lotta powder burns no Hook Lotta powder burns tattooing all the way around here inside the ear down here even on top of the head Fitzharris So its clear from our test that the gun could not have been fired from just a few feet away There woulda been tattooing like on our dummy Our test evidence supports the autopsy evidence Without the telltale powder burns and tattooing it looks like suicide can be ruled out Or can it My scientific expert Raychelle has been looking at the results and she has a very interesting theory Burks What if the weapon was incredibly close so all of that matter and debris and hot gases coulda gone straight into the ear canal Thats an open space and youre not gonna see any of this debris embedded into the skin Fitzharris So in that case there could be a closerange shot into the right ear which is what the autopsy report says but no tattooing Burks It is a possibility Fitzharris This could change everything Was it or wasnt it suicide Fitzharris In the death of Pablo Escobar one suspect has been overlooked Escobar himself Could Pablo Escobars death have been suicide We know that a mm pistol shot through Escobars right ear killed him And now we have a theory that could explain the lack of tattooing Does this theory makes sence I asked Dr Melinek to doublecheck the official accounts Melinek What I found was that at the end of the autopsy report they had a press release Fitzharris A press release with autopsy But that seems really unusual Melinek It is In fact whats really unusual is that they specifically rule out suicide as a manner of death Ive never seen anything like that before attached to an autopsy report having a press release right there Fitzharris It sounds like theyre trying to eliminate a certain narrative here Melinek They are and maybe its because that gunshotwound trajectory which is going from right to left across the head is consistent with something that we typically see in suicide Fitzharris If the ballistics are potentially consistent with a suicide theory is there any supporting evidence from the runup to the raid In the week leading up to his death Pablo Escobars family tries and fails to leave Colombia Theyre then kept under government protection in a hotel in Bogota the Colombian capital Pablo knows the authorities are using his family as leverage Hes scared to strike back while his wife daughter and son are effectively being held hostage His enemies hold all the cards Reporter Kidnappings Colombian police continue Marroquin They were using us as a bait to catch my father The only thing he cared was the family My father became very desperate Fitzharris The search party used the best satellite tracking system available at the time in its hunt for Escobar but Escobar had been keeping his calls so short it wasnt possible to triangulate the signal with his location But on December nd it was different Carlos Palau was a member of the Search Bloc team Fitzharris Pablo gives himself away by making an unusually long phone call allowing the cops to track him down Why would he do that The call is to his son despairing music continues Marroquin That was truly the beginning of the end He understood that there was no more negotiations My father became very desperate and he start making calls He took one of the bravest decisions that he could have ever taken of letting the authorities know where he was Why Because he wanted to free us as family He understood that there was no way out for the whole family Somebody had to die Thats why he ask to speak with my little sister with my mom because he was saying goodbye enchanting music Fitzharris So where does the suicide theory fit into the ballistics Hook Well we know that Pablo had a SIG SAUER nine millimeter We know thats the weapon that caused the wound Although there was no tattooing we know that from the autopsy report we do now know that if it was a closecontact wound to the head all of that residue would actually go into the wound So consistent with suicide yeah Fitzharris So the science could back up the suicide theory Hook Yeah Fitzharris Escobars son has thought about that day for the last years Marroquin Place was surrounded He know he cant escape He told me for the past I dont know years of his life that if someday he feels surrounded he will put a bullet in his right ear He explained to me Dont put your gun in your mouth or here or here because the bullet can take another direction and wont make you any harm Fitzharris And this is exactly what killed Escobar a bullet to the ear but well never know if Sebastians memory is playing tricks or its an attempt to make his father see more noble Does Pablo Escobar kill himself I wouldnt rule it out A proud man hated the police and the government it could be his final victory to deny them the satisfaction of killing him But does the theory stand up to scrutiny Pedro Morales must have a view on the suicide theory Pedro speaks in foreign language Fitzharris But what if the bullet to his ear was fired before the bullet to his back when his arm was fully functioning And heres another thing Pedro Morales can only work from the official autopsy report We can clearly see that the report was made in chaotic circumstances DEA Agent Javier Pea has yet one more observation Fitzharris As Javier Pea confirms the politics of Colombia at the time were not just murky they were open to corruption We put this dummy through some grueling tests Its been shot up really bad Its helping us to get closer to the truth but weve heard some very challenging revelations His son claims Pablo killed himself Yet the autopsy rules out suicide Who am I to believe accomplished music continues The death of Pablo Escobar its hard to untangle a story with so many twists but based on my discoveries this is what I now believe Whether Pablo took the fatal shot or the cops did it for him Escobar took his fate into his own hands by giving up his location on a phone call to his family that day He always said Rather a tomb in Colombia than a prison cell in America And in the end thats what he got a tomb in Colombia tomb thuds\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n
